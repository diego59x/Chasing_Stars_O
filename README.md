# Chasing Starts
Chasing Stars is a single player, third person view, 3D video game that immerse the player in a journey through space. It sets the player in a little spaceship that has to wander in space as it avoids different meteoroids; and if they donâ€™t, the spaceship will crash in one of those such as it happens in outer space once a satellite losses orbits and collide with mater as well. The goal of the game is to involve the player to avoid as many collisions as possible while also wandering through the fascinating stars that we have in our galaxy. We aim to accomplish the goal of the challenge by having different colors of stars, each ones representing the different changes it has during the time of the day/night.
