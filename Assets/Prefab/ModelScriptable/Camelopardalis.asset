  description: "Commonly known as the \u201CGiraffe\u201D, It's a modern constellation
    in the northern hemisphere. Camelopardalis was documented for the first time
    in the seventeenth century and, therefore, was not known to ancient civilizations.

    It contains galaxies because it is in the opposite direction of the Milky Way,
    there\u2019s been eight stars with planets detected within this constellation."
