  description: "Also known as \u201CDove\u201D, it\u2019s a constellation from the
    south hemisphere, at the beginning the constellation was called the Dove from
    Noah, in reference to the dove that announced to Noah the end of the flood. The
    constellation Columba is only visible in its entirety from a latitude below 46
    degrees north. This constellation has a relatively low brightness, due only one
    of its stars has an apparent magnitude less than 3."
