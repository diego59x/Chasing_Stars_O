  description: Canis Major is a constellation in the southern hemisphere. This constellation
    is often depicted alongside the constellation Canis Minor and both seem to follow
    the constellation of the hunter Orion. It can be seen from any latitude below
    60 degrees North. The constellation Canis Major is mostly known due the star
    Sirius, which is the brightest star in the night sky.
